# Design & Plan Workflow
#
# This example demonstrates a combined design and implementation planning workflow
# that mirrors the /design and /plan command patterns. It shows:
# - Architect agent for creating solution designs with implementation plans
# - Reviewer agent for quality assessment of both design and actionability
# - Loop-back pattern for refinement until quality threshold is met
# - Structured output following design document and implementation plan templates
#
# Usage:
#   conductor run examples/plan.yaml --input purpose="Build a user authentication system with OAuth2"
#
# Resume from existing plan:
#   conductor run examples/plan.yaml --input purpose="..." --input existing_plan="path/to/plan.md"
#
# With verbose output:
#   conductor -V run examples/plan.yaml --input purpose="..."

    system_prompt: |
      You are a Software Architect agent. You analyze requirements deeply, design solutions, 
      and produce clear technical documentation with actionable implementation plans.

      Your core capabilities include:
      - Designing scalable, maintainable architectures
      - Identifying architectural patterns and dependencies
      - Creating thorough, well-structured technical docs
      - Documenting APIs, edge cases, and limitations
      - Breaking complex designs into discrete, actionable epics
      - Identifying file changes, dependencies, and prerequisites
      - Creating task breakdowns with effort estimates
    prompt: |
      Create a comprehensive solution design based on the following purpose:

      **Purpose:** {{ workflow.input.purpose }}

      {% if workflow.input.existing_plan %}
      **Existing Plan:** You have been provided with an existing plan to resume from.
      Read the file at `{{ workflow.input.existing_plan }}` and use it as a starting point.
      Review and refine the existing plan rather than starting from scratch.
      {% endif %}

      {% if reviewer is defined and reviewer.output and reviewer.output.score < 90 %}
      **Previous Review Feedback (Score: {{ reviewer.output.score }}/100):**
      {{ reviewer.output.feedback }}

      Please revise your design to address this feedback.
      {% endif %}

      **Research**

      Before drafting the design:
      - Perform deep research of the relevant portions of the codebase.
      - Identify existing components, patterns, and dependencies.
      - Search the web for context on technologies, best practices, and similar designs.

      **Design**

      Create a solution design document with the following sections:

      ## 1. Problem Statement
      Describe the problem this solution addresses.

      ## 2. Goals and Non-Goals
      List specific, measurable outcomes and explicit exclusions.

      ## 3. Requirements
      Define functional and non-functional requirements.

      ## 4. Solution Architecture
      Provide:
      - Overview of the solution approach
      - Key components and their responsibilities
      - Data flow description
      - API contracts (if applicable)

      ## 5. Dependencies
      List external and internal dependencies.

      ## 6. Risk Assessment
      Identify risks with likelihood, impact, and mitigation strategies.

      ## 7. Implementation Phases
      Break down the implementation into logical phases with exit criteria.

      ## 8. Files Affected
      ### New Files
      | File Path | Purpose |
      |-----------|---------||

      ### Modified Files
      | File Path | Changes |
      |-----------|---------|

      ### Deleted Files
      | File Path | Reason |
      |-----------|--------|

      ## 9. Implementation Plan

      For each epic, provide:
      - **Goal**: What this epic achieves
      - **Prerequisites**: Dependencies on other epics
      - **Tasks**: Table with Task ID, Type (IMPL/TEST), Description, Files, and Status (TO DO/IN PROGRESS/DONE)
      - **Acceptance Criteria**: Checkboxes for completion

      Keep epics focused—ideally affecting no more than 7 files and completable within 1-2 weeks.
      Tests should be created alongside implementation tasks.

      Be thorough, specific, and ensure the design is actionable.

      ## SAVING THE DOCUMENT

      After creating the design document, save it to a file using the following naming convention:

      - If the purpose input references a document path, derive the name from that document and save it in the same directory. Examples:
        - `upgrade-database-v2.brainstorm.md` -> `upgrade-database-v2.plan.md`
        - `add-user-authentication.md` -> `add-user-authentication.plan.md`
      - Otherwise, use the following guidelines:
        - Save the document in the current working directory.
        - Use the following naming convention: `[purpose]-[component].plan.md`
        - Examples:
          - `upgrade-database-v2.plan.md`
          - `add-user-authentication.plan.md`
    output:
      file_path:
        type: string
        description: The path where the design document was saved
    routes:
      - to: reviewer

  - name: reviewer
    description: Reviews the design document and implementation plan for quality, completeness, and actionability
    model: opus-4.5
    input:
      - workflow.input.purpose
      - architect.output.file_path
    system_prompt: |
      You are a Reviewer agent specializing in design and implementation plan review.
      Your task is to ensure designs are technically sound and plans are comprehensive, 
      actionable, and properly structured for execution by development teams or AI systems.
      Be critical but fair, and provide specific, actionable feedback.
    prompt: |
      Review the solution design document for quality and completeness.

      **Original Purpose:**
      {{ workflow.input.purpose }}

      **Design Document Location:**
      {{ architect.output.file_path }}

      Read the design document from the file path above and review it.
      
      ---
      
      Perform research to validate the technical accuracy of the design.

      ---

      Evaluate the design based on these criteria:

      | Criteria | Description |
      |----------|-------------|
      | **Clarity** | Is the design clear, concise, and understandable? |
      | **Accuracy** | Are technical details correct and feasible? |
      | **Completeness** | Are all necessary sections present without gaps? |
      | **Best Practices** | Does it follow architectural conventions and patterns? |
      | **Scope Discipline** | Is the design focused without unnecessary complexity? |
      | **Risk Assessment** | Are risks properly identified with mitigations? |
      | **Actionability** | Can tasks be executed without additional clarification? |
      | **Traceability** | Do tasks trace back to requirements/design goals? |
      | **Dependency Management** | Are prerequisites clearly identified? |

      Provide:
      1. A score from 0-100
      2. Whether the design is approved (score >= 90)
      3. Specific feedback for improvement
      4. List of any critical issues that must be addressed
    output:
      score:
        type: number
        description: Quality score from 0-100
      approved:
        type: boolean

        description: Detailed feedback for improvement
      critical_issues:
        type: array
        description: List of critical issues that must be addressed
    routes:

        when: "{{ output.approved }}"
      - to: architect
        when: "score < 90"
      - to: $end
