# PyPI Publishing workflow for Copilot Conductor
#
# Publishes the package to PyPI when a release is created.
# Uses trusted publishing (OIDC) for secure authentication.
#
# Prerequisites:
# 1. Configure trusted publisher on PyPI:
#    - Go to https://pypi.org/manage/project/copilot-conductor/settings/publishing/
#    - Add GitHub as trusted publisher
#    - Repository: your-org/copilot-conductor
#    - Workflow: publish.yml
#    - Environment: pypi
#
# Usage:
# 1. Update version in pyproject.toml
# 2. Commit and push changes
# 3. Create a new release on GitHub with tag matching version (e.g., v0.1.0)
# 4. The workflow will automatically build and publish to PyPI
